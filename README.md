This is hosting a Github Page here: https://unispace365.github.io/google-expressions-taboret-static/

Erik Sterpa requested that we host the Google Taboret content for demo purposes, could be public and with no authentication, and this was an easy way to do it.

The process to update and deploy is:

1. Go to https://unispace365.github.io/google-expressions-taboret-static/ and sync the fork with the source repo
2. Run the deploy action from this repo
